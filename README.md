### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

What is the circle of life?

turning ... 

... coffee into code

... code into bugs

... bugs into debugging

... debugging into depression

... depression into searching stackoverflow

... searching stackoverflow into finding the right solution

... finding the right solution and feeling successful

... feeling successful and getting another coffee to write some more code ...
